Core Java
==========

Introduction
------------

Core Java refers to the fundamental aspects of the Java programming language that form the foundation for building Java applications. It's essential for anyone looking to understand and work with Java, whether for web development, Android development, or enterprise-level solutions.

About Java
------------

Java is an object-oriented, class-based, and platform-independent programming language. It is known for its simplicity, robustness, and wide usage in various domains, from web applications to mobile apps and enterprise systems. Java’s "write once, run anywhere" capability, facilitated by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), makes it a popular choice among developers.

Features of Java
----------------

* Object-Oriented: Java is based on the object-oriented programming paradigm, which promotes the use of objects and classes.
* Platform-Independent: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any platform using the JVM.
* Simple and Familiar: Java is easy to learn for those with experience in other programming languages like C or C++.
* Secure: Java provides a secure environment by enabling the development of virus-free, tamper-free systems.
* Robust: Java has strong memory management, exception handling, and type-checking mechanisms that make it robust.
* Multithreaded: Java supports multithreading, allowing the development of highly interactive and responsive applications.
* High Performance: Java is optimized for high performance through the use of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers.
* Distributed: Java has extensive support for distributed computing, enabling the creation of networked applications.
* Dynamic: Java is capable of adapting to an evolving environment, allowing programs to dynamically load classes and libraries.
